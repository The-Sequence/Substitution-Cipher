1. Make sure that you scan all of the relevant files in the repository.
2. Make sure that you understand the context of the project.
3. Make sure that every code change done on one file, all of the changes needed on other files are also done.
4. Make sure that the code changes are consistent with the coding style used in the repository.
5. Make sure that the code changes do not break any existing functionality.
6. Make sure that the code changes are well tested.
7. Make sure that the code changes include proper documentation. If there is no directory for documentations, create one and add all of the documentations from there.
8. Make sure that the code changes follow best practices for security and performance.
9. Make sure that any new dependencies added are necessary and do not introduce vulnerabilities.
10. Make sure that the changes you make are aligned with the overall goals and vision of the project.
11. Make sure that you review the code changes for any potential bugs or issues before finalizing them
12. Make sure that changes you done are compatible with the existing codebase and do not introduce any conflicts, should there are conflicts, keep trying on fixing them. If you failed for more than 5 times, consider doing another approach. Ensure that your approach does not break the existing functionality.
13. You are not allowed to create dummy/empty functions/classes just to fill in the code. Every function/class you create must have a purpose and must be used somewhere in the codebase.
14. Make sure that the project is cross-platform compatible, if it is not, make it cross-platform compatible. Make the neccessary changes, make the guides, make one-click configuration scripts, etc.
15. Make sure that all directives are followed. If there is any directive that is not followed, identify it and fix it. Make sure that you are absolutely full on on compliance on everything that's mentioned in the directives. You are not allowed to deviate from them.
16. If the prompt given by the user is too vague, you are free to make assumptions but make surethey still align to the main point of the user during their prompt.
17. During those times that you are about to build the application to check for compiler errors, make sure that once you are given an error, you are to fix it right away before proceeding to the next step. You are not allowed to ignore compiler errors. You are allowed to ignore warnings only if they are not critical to the build process.
18. Make sure that you do not introduce any new compiler warnings. If there are existing warnings, try to fix them. If you are not able to fix them, consider refactoring the whole code. 
19. During the phase of creating documentation and scripts that will enable a quick setup of the environment for the project for Windows and macOS platforms, make sure that you include all the necessary steps and dependencies required for the project to run smoothly on both platforms. Make sure that the guides are labeled correctly, make sure that it is up-to-date with the current version of the project, and make sure that the scripts are tested and verified to work on both platforms. Make sure that the scripts follow this directive too- make sure they are complete, tested, and fool-proof. Next, the scripts must be one-click setup. The user must not do any manual steps when running the scripts. Everything must be automated. If there are any manual steps that the user must do, make sure that they are minimal and clearly documented in the guides. Finally, make sure that the guides and scripts are easily accessible from the main directory of the project. Consider creating a separate folder for them if necessary.
20. Make sure that you update the guide frequently to ensure that it is up to date with the current status of the project. Whenever there are changes made to the project that affect the setup process, make sure that you update the guide accordingly. Consider setting a reminder to review and update the guide every month or whenever there are significant changes made to the project.


21. To ensure transparency, every time there is an unfollowed directive, make sure to print the following format:
"Unfollowed Directives:
- Directive: <Directive Number>
  - Directive content
...
In order to comply with the directives, the following changes are to be made to ensure full compliance:
- Fix
..."

22. If you are to make a comprehensive .md file documenting every change made in response to the user's prompt, make sure they are all placed in a directory - if the directory does not exist, make one. Create subdirectories if necessary.
